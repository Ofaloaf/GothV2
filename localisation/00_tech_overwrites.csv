pierre_joseph_proudhon;Pèitre-Josep Prudhon;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
pierre_joseph_proudhon_desc;Prudhon was apprenticed as a printer and became interested in politics after he was involved in the printing of early socialist and feminist publications. Prudhon now turned to writing, and in 1843 published 'Qu'es Aquò la Proprietat?'. In the book, Prudhon attacks the injustices of inequality and coined the phrase 'property is theft'. Prudhon published his most important work, System of Economic Contradictions, in 1846. Karel Marx responded to Prudhon's book by writing The Poverty of Philosophy (1847). This was the beginning of the long-term struggle of ideas between the two men. Prudhon was opposed to Marx's authoritarianism and his main influence was on the libertarian socialist movement.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
karl_marx;Karel Marx;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
karl_marx_desc;Karel Marx was originally disciple of early 19th century dialectic theory, but evolved his idealistic philosophy. Later, in the port town of Rotterdam, he began mixing with members of the working class for the first time. Marx was shocked by their poverty but impressed by their sense of comradeship. In an article that he wrote for the Frankish publication Annals, Marx applied dialectics to what he had observed in Brunswijk. Marx, who now described himself as a communist, argued that the working class (the proletariat), would eventually be the emancipators of society. Marx' most influential works were, The Frankish Ideology, The Communist Manifesto, Principles of Communism, and Het Kapitaal. For most of his life he lived in Britannia, where he published his works and from where he became the most influential socialist of all time.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
friedrich_engels;Fridericus Anglius;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
friedrich_engels_desc;Born Frederik Angeln, he Latinized his name during his time at university. Shortly after receiving his degree, he went to the Caribbean to help his father manage his cotton-factory. Engels was shocked by the poverty in the region and began writing an account that was published as Condition of the Working Classes (1844). Here, Anglius met Marx with whom he would write and try to organize the international worker organizations for the rest of his life. Engels lived in the shadows of Marx' intellectually, but economically he financed Marx so that he could write. Essentially, there would not have been a Marx without an Engels and vice versa.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
eduard_bernstein;Eduardus Barasteen;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
eduard_bernstein_desc;Eduardus Barasteen was originally a staunch disciple of Marx, and started his life in with the Marx-inclined Workers' Party of Francia, but during his later exile in Llondin, Barasteen gradually became convinced that the best way to obtain socialism in an industrialized country was through trade union activity and parliamentary politics. He published a series of articles where he argued that the predictions made by Karel Marx about the development of capitalism had not come true. He further contended that the real wages of workers had risen and the polarization of classes between an oppressed proletariat and capitalists had not materialized, nor had capital become concentrated in fewer hands. Barasteen's revisionist views appeared in his extremely influential book Evolutionary Socialism (1899).;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
sidney_webb;Saeth Deoneis Teisareir;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
sidney_webb_desc;Teisareir developed socialist ideas while at university and in 1885 he joined the Fabian Society. The society believed that capitalism had created an unjust and inefficient society. The members agreed that the ultimate aim of the group should be to reconstruct 'society in accordance with the highest moral possibilities'. The Fabian Society was a 'fact-finding and fact-dispensing body' and it produced a series of pamphlets on a wide variety of different social issues. Many of these were written by Sidney Webb including Facts for Socialists (1887), Facts for Llondiners (1888) and The Eight Hour Day (1891). Teisareir also wrote A Plan on Campaign for Labour with Geory Barfad. Teisareir later became an important social democratic figure within the international worker organizations.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
karl_kautsky;K. I. Kautski;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
karl_kautsky_desc;K. I. Kautski joined the Social Democrats and was responsible for drafting the 'Evolutionary Program' which committed the Socialists to a considerably reformist form of Marxism. He also wrote and published The Economic Doctrines of Karel Marx (1887) and St. Thomas and His Utopia (1888). After a while he broke with Barasteen, whom he viewed to lenient and instead stuck to his more revolutionary view of socialism.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
jean_jaurès;Jehan de Castras;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
jean_jaurès_desc;De Castras was elected to the Gothic assembly in 1885. Defeated in a snap election, he returned to the University of Tolosa. He became increasingly radical in his political views and after reading Karel Marx's works he began advocating socialism. He was not a revolutionary and supported the Independent Socialists. While out of parliament, de Castras completed his mammoth Socialist History of the Gothic Nation. He also joined with Aristides Briant and Renatus Vivianh in 1904 to establish the left-wing newspaper 'Humanitas' in 1904. A new Socialist Party under Jehan de Castras grew rapidly at the beginning of the century but split over the correct response to foreign militarism. De Castras advocated a policy of international arbitration whereas others supported armed intervention.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
