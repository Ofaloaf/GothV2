EVTNAME1000;Socialists;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC1000;Philosophers interested in promoting labor's ownership of the means of production and highlighting class struggle have gathered together to establish the First International, meant to be a central organ for spreading their ideas. This has led to workers in $COUNTRY$ to found a party dedicated to advancing the agenda laid out by the International. They call themselves socialists and believe in a land ruled by the workers, where the workers control the means of production. Equality, justice, solidarity and democracy are other vital points in the socialists' ideology.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

genetics:_heredity_desc;Heredity Genetics were a major step towards the understanding of life itself. Carantanian priest Rehor Mendel (1822-84) assumed that every trait an organism contains is written down in some material factors and are transferred during the process of reproduction. In experiments with his pea plants he could prove his thesis.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10001;While the conservative monarchies of Europe shed millions of lives in dynastic disputes, the revolutionary republic of Britannia wallowed in a golden age of peace and prosperity. From the corpse-ridden meadows of the Rhineland and freezing passes of the Alps, people are beginning to question the old order. Away from the still-smouldering battlefields, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10300;The chamber of commerce in one of our states has lodged an angry protest with local government, complaining that the government's interventionist economic policies harm local businesses. Taking a cue from Enlightenment rhetoric about natural laws, the Chamber of Commerce demands that the government's policy change, and that they be left alone to conduct business in the manners which they see fit. If their demands are not met, they threaten to raise the issue to the national level.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
