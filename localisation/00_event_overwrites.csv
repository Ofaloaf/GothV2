EVTNAME1000;Socialists;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC1000;Philosophers interested in promoting labor's ownership of the means of production and highlighting class struggle have gathered together to establish the First International, meant to be a central organ for spreading their ideas. This has led to workers in $COUNTRY$ to found a party dedicated to advancing the agenda laid out by the International. They call themselves socialists and believe in a land ruled by the workers, where the workers control the means of production. Equality, justice, solidarity and democracy are other vital points in the socialists' ideology.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

We can take this opportunity to push the agenda for greater citizenship rights, or we can anger his supporters by simply ignoring the speech.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

The Third Way, or fascists as they might be called, are looking to get a seat in the Upper House.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC1004;We want, no, we NEED a free society, where no one is considered to be superior, no one is left behind and where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity. We need a society without a government, without class divisions and where the workers control the means of production.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

genetics:_heredity_desc;Heredity Genetics were a major step towards the understanding of life itself. Carantanian priest Rehor Mendel (1822-84) assumed that every trait an organism contains is written down in some material factors and are transferred during the process of reproduction. In experiments with his pea plants he could prove his thesis.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10001;While the conservative monarchies of Europe shed millions of lives in dynastic disputes, the revolutionary republic of Britannia wallowed in a golden age of peace and prosperity. From the corpse-ridden meadows of the Rhineland and freezing passes of the Alps, people are beginning to question the old order. Away from the still-smouldering battlefields, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10300;The chamber of commerce in one of our states has lodged an angry protest with local government, complaining that the government's interventionist economic policies harm local businesses. Taking a cue from Enlightenment rhetoric about natural laws, the Chamber of Commerce demands that the government's policy change, and that they be left alone to conduct business in the manners which they see fit. If their demands are not met, they threaten to raise the issue to the national level.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

It is in our interests to promote immigration, and provide incentives for settlers along our frontier.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10000;The relative quiet of the early 19th century was broken with a crashing revelry in $YEAR$, as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the continent. The old monarchies of Europe could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the British revolution could again be heard echoing from Europe's tumultuous streets, and student's and youth again gathered under republican tricolors, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in political, social and national affairs -- that was European Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10140;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $PROVINCENAME$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society. Whether it be Rosicrucians, Freemasons or The Roman Illuminati, someone is spreading liberal ideas in $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10220;The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that $PROVINCENAME$ was, up until just recently, a hot-bed of liberal agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is a revolutionary in a Phrygian cap, the iconographic personification of the British Revolution, holding a republican tricolor. The pamphlet reads: 'Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood -- $COUNTRY$'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
