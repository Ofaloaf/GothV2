EVTNAME123000;The Commune is here!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123000;In the wake of the revolution, the whole social order has turned upside down. Workers are dancing in the streets, and the old elites are withdrawing to their estates, scowling. While we can't expect much help in the future from the old regime's plutocrats, we are hopeful that the People will be able to step into the breach.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME123002;Anarchist Printing Press;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME123006;Parliamentary Crisis - Anarchist Republic;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123006;Anarchists have somehow won control of the government! They object vehemently to what they call the "bourgeois state", and have vowed to form a goverment (or "federation", there seems to be some debate on terms) of the People. We can't allow this- can we?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123007;Conservatives reject the government;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123007;Decrying the government as 'illegitimate' and 'criminal', prominent conservatives have refused to participate in national elections, and have encouraged their supporters to boycott the vote.

EVTOPTA123007;That's their loss;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123008;Conservatives return;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123008;Excited by the return of 'legitimate authority', leading conservatives have come out of the woodwork to endorse the new national government and encourage conservatives to express their support at the ballot box.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123008;OK.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123009;Liberal Schism;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123009;The nation's liberals have split over how to acknowledge the new revolutionary government. Some reject any recognition of it, much less participation in it, while others believe that it must be engaged with for the sake of political reform. Some go even further, and have joined their Radical colleagues in agitating for radical protections of liberty and equality without getting bogged down in 'materialist' concerns like a minimum wage and pensions.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123009;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123010;Liberals Reconciled;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123010;The old wounds of the revolutionary regime have begun to fade, and many of the differences which had caused the nation's liberal movement to splinter have begun to heal. Many liberal defectors to the Radicals have returned to the fold, and old supporters are re-energized and ready to vote at the ballot box again.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123010;OK.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510000;Agitating for liberty!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510000;Terra Equinoxialis and Gothia's other colonies have groaned under the weight of mercantilist policies and gross abuse of power for far too long. In the north, Gothia's colonies in Mexico and along the Mississippi recently managed to wrest independence from the tyrannical government in Liyun, and it's high time we aspire for independence as well!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME510002;The Great Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510002;Our supposedly loyal colony of Terra Equinoxialis has sent us an ultimatum, demanding we immediately grand it total independence 'or else face the consequences'. Reports from our men on the ground also suggest that there may be Equinoxialian sympathizers in other colonial governments. We must tread carefully- we do not know the full extent of this conspiracy directed against us. Should we fight these upstart rebels and whoever their friends may be, or should we capitulate?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510002;We shall fight!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB510002;Better to let the colonials go.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510003;A Great Conspiracy?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510003;Rumors have reached us, suggesting that elements of Terra Equinoxialis' colonial government have begun conspiring against us and covertly agitating for their own independence. We should be wary- we have no idea when they may try to strike, and what schemes they may concoct in the process.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

His sister, Princess Onecca, will be crowned Queen Onecca shortly. Liberals are excited by Onecca's ascension, as the heir is known to be a free thinker.

EVTNAME500001;The Panama Canal reopens!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC500001;Construction on the Canal first began in 1730, and by the middle of the century small ships were able to cross the isthmus via the canal. However, 18th-century construction methods were crude compared to modern techniques, and the Canal has occassionally needed to be closed for maintenance and upgrades. The latest round of renovations was extremely challenging, but it has finally completed, and now the canal is open and ready for work once more.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA500001;Imagine this century without the Canal! How horrifying.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME500003;An heir to Onecca?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC500003;As the years progress, questions about the succession to the throne and Queen Onecca's heir have become louder and louder. The government has already put out quiet feelers to some of the most prestigious dynasties of Europe, and has now approached Queen Onecca herself about naming an heir to the throne.

No rumors of ill health had spread in the papers, no reports of doctors rushing to the royal palace. Her passing came with no warning. The government, unprepared, had no plan her place for her death. Unsurprisingly, pretenders have already crawled out of the woodwork to claim the Gothic crown for themselves. One particularly charismatic claimant has already amassed a large following and is marching towards the capital. The government could surrender the crown to this upstart at the cost of national dignity, but some member's of Onecca's council have also proposed forming a 'Long Regency Council' out of the Queen's inner circle. More radical voices have proposed simply abolishing the monarchy altogether, and ceding all executive power to an elected body, such as a reformed Senate.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
