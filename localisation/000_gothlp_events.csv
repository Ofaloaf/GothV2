EVTNAME123000;The Commune is here!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123000;In the wake of the revolution, the whole social order has turned upside down. Workers are dancing in the streets, and the old elites are withdrawing to estates, scowling. While we can't expect much help in the future from the old regime's plutocrats, we are hopeful that the People will be able to step into the breach.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT123000;Hurrah for the People!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123001;The Markets are freed!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123001;After the tumult of the revolution, order has at last been restored. People are settling down and returning to their natural place in society.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVYOPT123001;Thank goodness sanity has returned!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123002;Anarchist Printing Press;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123002;An anarchist organization has covertly set up a press and begun distributing their incendiary publications across the country. Worse still, some people are reading their drivel!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123002;Say, this is riveting stuff!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB123002;Try to find the press and shut this down!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123003;Anarchist Soup Kitchens;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123003;Anarchists have taken advantage of our unfortunate unemployment problems to provide their own relief services for people hard-hit by economic uncertainty. Some people are taking them up on their offer.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123003;Let the poor have their soup.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB123003;We must stop these anarchists!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME123004;Propaganda of the deed!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123004;An anarchist had assassinated a government minister! The assassin refused to recant his views after his capture, and even as he was marched to the gallows, he called for people to rise up against the government.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123004;Crack down on these anarchists!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME123005;Radical Unions Demand Self-Management;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC123005;A deluge of pamphlets and chants have flooded the streets, all demanding one thing: control of industries by the workers themselves. It's a radical demand, backed by the more militant and extreme trade unions.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA123005;Let them say what they want.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB123005;This sort of radicalism cannot be tolerated!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510000;Agitating for liberty!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510000;Terra Equinoxialis and Gothia's other colonies have groaned under the weight of mercantilist policies and gross abuse of power for far too long. In the north, Gothia's colonies in Mexico and along the Mississippi recently managed to wrest independence from the tyrannical government in Liyun, and it's high time we aspire for independence as well!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510000;We will have to tread carefully...;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510001;Ultimatum to Gothia?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510001;Every day, the cries for independence and liberty grow ever-louder. Now is the time to strike! Now is the time for action! If we hestitate now, our great conspiracy will be in jeopardy!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510001;Issue the demands;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB510001;Actually, you know what? Never mind all this.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510002;The Great Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510002;Our supposedly loyal colony of Terra Equinoxialis has sent us an ultimatum, demanding we immediately grand it total independence 'or else face the consequences'. Reports from our men on the ground also suggest that there may be Equinoxialian sympathizers in other colonial governments. We must tread carefully- we do not know the full extent of this conspiracy directed against us. Should we fight these upstart rebels and whoever their friends may be, or should we capitulate?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510002;We shall fight!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB510002;Better to let the colonials go.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510003;A Great Conspiracy?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510003;Rumors have reached us, suggesting that elements of Terra Equinoxialis' colonial government have begun conspiring against us and covertly agitating for their own independence. We should be wary- we have no idea when they may try to strike, and what schemes they may concoct in the process.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510004;Gothia declares war!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510004;The Gothic government has refused to grant us independence peacefully. So be it- let us win our liberty if it will not be granted.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510004;To arms, ye who yearn for freedom!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510005;The call to arms;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510005;The Equinoxialians have called us to fight- now is the time for our great struggle for independence.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510005;Let us fight for freedom!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510006;Peruvian co-conspirators?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510006;The cause of freedom and our own struggle for independence would be greatly bolstered by the help of our repressed brothers. Should we reach out to the Peruvians and see if they are willing to commit to the struggle?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510006;Let's make an offer to Peru.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB510006;Our struggle is ours alone.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME510013;Invitation to Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC510013;Equinoxialian agents have covertly contacted us, making vague noises about 'the Great Struggle'. We gather that they aim to fight for their independence at some point, and want to see if we also want to join the fight. Shall we commit ourselves to the cause of independence? If we commit ourselves now, we won't be able to back out when the time comes.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA510013;We will join their plot.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB510013;Our loyalties lay with Gothia!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME500000;The Death of Pèitre VI;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC500000;Pèitre VI, King of Gothia since 1806, passed away peacefully last night after a period of illness and declining health. His daughter, Princess Onecca, will be crowned Queen Onecca shortly. Liberals are excited by Onecca's ascension, as the heir is known to be a free thinker. Others express a note of concern, as Onecca, born in 1805, has yet to marry, much less have any children.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME500001;The Panama Canal reopens!;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC500001;Construction on the Canal first began in 1730, and by the middle of the century small ships were able to cross the isthmus via the canal. However, 18th-century construction methods were crude compared to modern techniques, and the Canal has occassionally needed to be closed for maintenance and upgrades. The latest round of renovations was extremely challenging, but it has finally completed, and now the canal is open and ready for work once more.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME500001_NEWS_LONG;The Panama Canal has reopened, after a period of reconstruction and renovations. After prolonged period closed, the canal is open for business again, and this time the builders say that the newest work done should last for a century.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME500002;Queen Onecca has no heir;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC500002;Queen Onecca still has not married and still has not produced any heirs. The years have begun to take their toll on her, and it is extremely unlikely she will ever be able to produce an heir at this point, even if she wanted to.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME500003;An heir to Onecca?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC500003;As the years progress, questions about the succession to the throne and Queen Onecca's heir have become louder and louder. The government has already put out quiet feelers to some of the most prestigious dynasties of Europe, and has now approached Queen Onecca herself about naming an heir to the throne. Each dynasty has its own preferred style of government, and will likely try to institute it in Gothia should they succeed to the throne. Which dynasty should inherit Onecca's crown?;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA500003;The Frankish branch of the House of Margens will respect our ways.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB500003;The Romanian Calcahn dynasty will bring autocracy and order.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC500007;Queen Onecca's death, although long and anxiously anticipated, still caught the nation by surprise. No rumors of ill health had spread in the papers, no reports of doctors rushing to the royal palace. Her passing came with no warning. The government, unprepared, had no plan her place for her death. Unsurprisingly, pretenders have already crawled out of the woodwork to claim the Gothic crown for themselves. One particularly charismatic claimant has already amassed a large following and is marching towards the capital. The government could surrender the crown to this upstart at the cost of national dignity, but some member's of Onecca's council have also proposed forming a 'Long Regency Council' out of the Queen's inner circle. More radical voices have proposed simply abolishing the monarchy altogether, and ceding all executive power to an elected body, such as a reformed Senate.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
